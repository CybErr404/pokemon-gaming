**PROJECT 1 - MIA W.**

**WELCOME TO THE PROBABILITY AND APPLIED STATISTICS PROJECT 1 REPOSITORY!**
This repository contains documentation, code, Excel sheet data, calculations and graphs, formulas, and other written works needed for Probability and Applied Statistics
at Stockton University. All code (minus the Chimchar class and a small part of the Rare Candy Monte Carlo) and papers have been written by me, Mia, and everything has
been created for Project 1 which is the first project of the spring 2024 semester.


**Contributors / people who helped me with this repository:**
Garret Chmielewski (Added the Chimchar class), Jake Cubernot (Helped guide me on how to complete the Rare Candy Monte Carlo)


**NAVIGATION** Go through the src folder to find everything!

**CODE -**
Contains code from the Pokemon project, the Stats Library, and the Set Operations library.

**Stats Library -** This includes a full list of the following:
Mean, median, mode, classic variance, classic standard deviation, the mn rule, permutations,
combinations, a factorial method using both Longs and BigInteger, conditional probability formulas
(both P(A|B) and P(B|A)), an independent and dependent checker, the Multiplicative Law of
Probability, the General Addition Rule Axiom, the odds of something not occurring,
the Theorem of Total Probability, Bayes Theorem, the combinatorial PMF, the Binomial Distribution PMF,
the expected value, variance, and standard deviation for binomial distribution, the Geometric
Distribution PMF, the expected value, variance, and standard deviation for geometric distribution,
the Hypergeometric Distribution PMF, the expected value, variance, and standard deviation for
hypergeometric distribution, the Negative Binomial Distribution PMF, and the expected value,
variance, and standard deviation for negative binomial distribution.

**Set Operations -** Union, intersection, and complement.

**Birthday Program -** The formula learned from a book homework problem to find the probability of someone else sharing your birthday in a room.

**Pokemon Card Game -** Attackable interface, Pokemon cards, Energy cards, Trainer cards (including Professor's Research, NestBall, etc.), and Rare Candy cards (for
the second Monte Carlo).

**Monte Carlo Simulations -** The first Monte Carlo simulation computes the probability of having a Pokemon in your hand when there's only one Pokemon in the entire
deck all the way up to there being 60 Pokemon in the deck (mostly 100% probability that if there's a significantly large amount of Pokemon in your deck, you'll
draw one in your hand). The second Monte Carlo simulation computes the probability of having a "bricked deck." That is, having rare candies in your Prize Pile and *not*
your hand along with having zero Pokemon in your hand.


**GARRET'S CHIMCHAR CLASS -**
The Chimchar code was added by Garret Chmielewski during our GitHub assignment in which we were to add code or comments to someone else's repository. CHIMCHAR, USE EMBER!


**WRITTEN WORKS -**
This sections consists of documentation, including written paragraphs on all methods coded in the Stats Library, the Set Operation library, and the Pokemon card game.
Also included is a GitHub essay on Git, workflow, merging, merge conflicts, commits, pushes, and pulls, screenshots, and a formula sheet.

Hopefully you enjoy your stay! I hope to continue adding to this even when I don't have the class anymore.

Also, personal comments:
Thank you to everyone who encouraged me during this project! My first game was Pokemon X, and I've loved the franchise ever since.
